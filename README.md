# Neural Network on MNIST and Face Datasets

This project implements a Multilayer Neural Network to classify handwritten digits and extends the analysis to a more complex face dataset. It compares the performance of the multilayer network against a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch.

## Key Features

- Implementation of a Multilayer Neural Network for MNIST digit classification  
- Application of the same architecture to a challenging face dataset  
- Performance comparison between Multilayer Neural Network, Deep Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network  
- Utilization of the PyTorch framework for model development and training
