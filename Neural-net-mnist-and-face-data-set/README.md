# Neural-net-mnist-and-face-data-set
Implemented a Multilayer Neural Network and evaluate its performance in classifying handwritten digits. You will use the same network to analyze a more challenging face dataset and compare the performance of the neural network against a deep neural network and a convolutional neural network using the PyTorch library
